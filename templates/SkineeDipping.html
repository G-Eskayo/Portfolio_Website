                                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            </div>
                            <p>This project aims to revolutionize the experience of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
                                (CS:GO) players by providing an
                                intuitive and user-friendly platform for accessing, filtering, and purchasing in-game
                                skins. The core feature is a
                                sophisticated yet easy-to-use search engine, allowing players to quickly navigate
                                through an extensive database of skins
                                based on various parameters like rarity, color, pattern, or price range. Users can apply
                                multiple filters simultaneously
                                to refine their search, making it effortless to find skins that align with their
                                specific tastes and budget.</p>

                            <p>Additionally, the platform offers detailed views of each skin, including high-resolution
                                images, background information,
                                and user reviews, enabling players to make informed decisions. A unique comparison tool
                                is also available, allowing
                                users to juxtapose different skins side-by-side for a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>

                            <p>For those interested in acquiring skins, the platform facilitates a seamless purchasing
                                process. It integrates a secure
                                transaction system, ensuring a safe and reliable exchange. Users can buy skins directly
                                from the platform or through
                                trusted third-party vendors, all within a few clicks. This project not only enhances the
                                accessibility of CS:GO skins
                                but also enriches the overall gaming experience by making skin selection and acquisition
                                more enjoyable and less
                                time-consuming.

                            <p>Working on the backend of our software development project has been a deeply engaging and
                                rewarding journey. My role
                                primarily revolved around laying the technical groundwork for the website. This task
                                involved setting up intricate API
                                calls that formed the backbone of key pages such as the login, register, home, discover,
                                and user pages. This
                                foundational work was not just about writing code; it was about crafting the core of our
                                website's functionality and
                                user experience.</p>

                            <p>One of my major contributions was developing and managing user authentication databases.
                                This involved creating systems
                                to efficiently log new users, prevent the creation of duplicate usernames, and,
                                crucially, establish user sessions upon
                                login. This feature was pivotal in ensuring that our website remained exclusive and
                                secure, accessible only to
                                authenticated users.</p>

                                class="img-responsive pull-right" alt=""
                                style="margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                            <p>A particularly challenging yet fulfilling aspect of my work was integrating multer for
                                file uploads on the user page.
                                This feature lets users personalize their profiles with photos and descriptions, stored
                                in a dedicated 'userPage' table.
                                Implementing multer pushed me into new territories, requiring me to reconfigure the
                                docker-compose.yaml file and craft a
                                Dockerfile to ensure smooth integration and operation.</p>

                            <p>Towards the end of the project, I focused on developing the bookmark feature, a task that
                                involved navigating through
                                various backend complexities. This phase of the project was challenged when our API keys
                                were blocked, exemplifying the
                                unpredictable nature of software development and the reliance on external services.</p>
                            <p>Throughout this project, my role has been a blend of technical rigour and creative
                                problem-solving, contributing
                                significantly to shaping the website's functionality and curating the overall user
                                experience.</p>

                            <p>In order to create a running accessible website for our project, we used Microsoft Azure
                                to host a virtual machine that
                                ran on linux. On the vm, I was able to download all the necessary docker files and then
                                clone our github repository.
                                After cloning the code locally on the vm, the docker file was available to be executed
                                in order to get the site up and
                                running for others to access without running any code on their own computer. The dns for
                                our site was composed of our
                                recitation number and our team number.</p>
                            <p>There is a limit to how long we could keep the website up with Azure so after to
                                completion of the project I put it up
                                with Amazon Web Services.
